<h3>Chai Latte</h3>
Let me start off with the warm and cozy Chai Latte of M Bakery. It is very creamy and foamy, and the flavor of the spices really take the front stage here. In fact, the spices are really balanced, to the point that I could not easily distinguish among them, except, of course, for cinnamon, nutmeg, and anise. To cut the long story short, the Chai Latte of M Bakery is like enjoying a cinnamon roll...in a cup (in other words, the Chai Latte tastes like heaven)!
