<h3>Lechon Macau</h3>
Yeah! Yeah! is perhaps known for the Lechon Macau, a slab of roasted and fried pork liempo which is crispy on the outside (as in the skin) and juicy and meaty on the inside (as in the meat itself)! And to make things more interesting, try dipping a piece of Lechon Macau on yellow mustard! It's really a match made in heaven!
