<h3>Fried Pigeon</h3>
You may have heard of Roasted Peking Duck, but at Yeah! Yeah!, there is also such thing as a Fried Pigeon! It's really a must-try, because the meat really tastes sweet and smoky, something you would get from a typical Chinese-style roast. And it tastes all the better when sprinkled with the special seasoning that comes with it!
