<h3>Xiao Long Bao</h3>
Xiao Long Bao is really a common fixture in Chinese Restaurants, and Yeah! Yeah! is no exception. Xiao Long Bao is essentially a dimsum stuffed with a pork meatball and meaty soup. It is usually eaten this way: the Xiao Long Bao is first dipped in dark vinegar, then the skin is torn open to expose the soup (which one then slurps), then lastly the entire thing (including the pork meatball) is consumed. At Yeah! Yeah!, their Xiao Long Bao is really meaty and soupy!
