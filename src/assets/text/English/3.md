Famous in New York City for its sweet concoctions, the M Bakery (short for Magnolia Bakery) is definitely every dessert lover's paradise, made even sweeter by the fact that it actually has a branch here in the Philippines! Come inside and be amazed by its old-fashioned, Victorian-era style interiors, which resonates very well with the sights and smells of delicious and creatively decorated cupcakes and cakes. And speaking of creatively decorated cakes, you can even take a peek at the bakers and pastry chefs preparing, baking, and primping up those scrumptious cupcakes and cakes!
