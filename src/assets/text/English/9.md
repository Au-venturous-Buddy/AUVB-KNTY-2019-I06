<h3>Sweet and Sour Pork</h3>
Last on the list is the Sweet and Sour Pork, which is really packed with many flavors and textures! Not only was the breaded pork very meaty, the vegetables and most especially the sauce definitely brings up the wow factor in this dish! This is definitely something that would perk up your taste buds with its sweet and sour tones!

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
Yeah! Yeah! is definitely not your typical Chinese restaurant. A lot of the dishes there are really a must-try, most of which are beyond the typical roasted meat and dimsum. Furthermore, the service there is very fast, and the ambience of the restaurant is great! One thing to watch out though: A lot of their best-selling items (like the Mushroom Bun) can quickly run out of stock, so if you want to try out the best of the best at Yeah! Yeah!, better have your fingers crossed!
