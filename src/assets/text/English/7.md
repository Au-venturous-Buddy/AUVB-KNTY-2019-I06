<h3>Banana Pudding</h3>
Nothing indeed makes a good accompaniment to a warm Chai Latte than a dessert made of bananas! And M Bakery's Banana Pudding is no exception. It's made with pieces of banana slices and pound cake, mixed into creamy pudding made even more decadent with swirls of chocolate fudge. It's so very sweet and creamy that, as I've mentioned earlier, it goes best with a warm drink like the Chai Latte (and even a glass of warm water).

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
For a person with a sweet tooth, M Bakery should definitely be in your bucket list. This cafe evokes the feeling of enjoying sweet treats at home with its late 19th century to early 20th century interiors and the scenery of cupcakes and cakes baked fresh everyday. Best of all, their drinks, most especially the Chai Latte, are among the best Iâ€™ve ever tasted. And their Banana Pudding is definitely something I would call a guilty pleasure!

PS I have actually tried their cupcakes, and they actually taste sweet yet subtle (most especially the smooth icing) ðŸ™‚
