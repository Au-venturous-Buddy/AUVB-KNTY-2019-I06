<h3>BBQ Pork Rice Roll</h3>
Out of curiosity, I also tried the BBQ Pork Rice Roll, and for me, it's my least favorite item on Yeah! Yeah!'s menu. In fact, there is more rice roll in that dish than there are pieces of pork. However, the sauce really tastes good, arguably the only bright spot in this dish.
